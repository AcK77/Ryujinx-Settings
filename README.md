# Ryujinx Settings

As any GUI for Ryujinx are available now, here is it a quick tool to configure the settings of Ryujinx easily, it's for Windows ONLY...

- You can automatically download and install OpenAL.
- Set all the Keys you want (Don't forget, Keyboard Keys use the QWERTY layout).
- Enabled all Logging you want.

Executable need to be placed in the same folder of `Ryujinx.conf`.
Don't forget there is no comments in the `.conf` file after you use the tool.

If you have an idea, want to update something, add more options, or whatever you want, you be free to do a pull request. I don't plan to maintain this tool updated.
Thanks.
